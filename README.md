## Introduction 🌟

Welcome to a customizable face recognition system designed to identify individuals in photographs based on a user-populated database of facial images. This powerful tool harnesses Python and its potent libraries, such as `face_recognition` and `opencv`, offering a blend of accuracy and user-centric functionality. Tailor the database with your images and let the system pinpoint matches with ease.

## Features 🚀

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces within images. 🔎
- **Face Recognition**: Matches detected faces against a pre-established database to identify individuals. 👤
- **Annotation**: Labels recognized faces with rectangles and their corresponding names. 🏷️
- **Scalability**: Designed with future enhancements in mind, including video file processing. 📈
